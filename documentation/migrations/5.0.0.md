Migrating to version 5.0.0
==========================

Since version `5.0.0` we have introduced a couple of non-backwards compatible changes. This guide 
helps you migrate from previous versions (< `4.0.0`).

# Migration steps

## Upgrade Elixir and OTP

Version `5.0.0` update the `amqp` client to version `4`, this means there are new requirements in terms of `elixir` and `erlang` version and the support to the new version of `rabbitmq`, version `4`.

This version is also compatible with `rabbitmq` version `3`

* Ensure you are using at least `Elixir 1.14`
* Ensure you are using at least `OTP 26`
